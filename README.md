### DETAILS

This repo is to hold all my assignments and relevant code for cs152 at CSU, Introduction to Python. 
Nothing too significant, just folding this into my workflow.


### WARNING

This is publicly available, hence indexable by any anti-cheat software the professors can and will use. This is all my original work, especially since I already
know python and do not need to use any external resources to complete these programs. Check both the Honor pledge for your respective university, 
as well as the specifics for each class before borrowing, using as a reference or copying. I understand the want/need to accomplish assignments, 
but I can promise you there are few people better on this earth at finding re-used code than a CS prof.

**I am NOT responisble for any misuse of this code.**

All that being said, if none of the above applies to you, feel free to copy, take or use this code in any way. This is an introduction to python course, 
and you could probably find cleaner code elsewhere, but you have my blessing to do whatever you want with this.
